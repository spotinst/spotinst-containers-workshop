# Docker workshop

A simple `docker` workshop for anyone who wants to learn how to use docker effectively in their day-to-day dev work.

This repo attempts to drive you through the fundamentals and into some advanced topics like `docker-compose` or docker's swarm mode.

This is, of course, a continuous work in progress; feel free to propose changes and spread the word.

Get started in the [`0-docker-basics`](https://github.com/gvilarino/docker-workshop/tree/master/0-docker-basics) section.

# Requirements

You'll need to have `docker 1.12` or later installed. Go ahead and [get the latest stable version here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

You may follow this repo almost entirely online with [`play-with-docker`](http://play-with-docker.com). If you need to access your services from outside, use the following URL pattern `http://ip<instance_ip>-<port>.play-with-docker.com` (i.e: http://ip10_2_135_3-80.play-with-docker.com/) Also, note that sessions there aren't permanent and your progress will get erased after some hours.
